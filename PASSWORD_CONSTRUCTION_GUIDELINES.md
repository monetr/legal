# Password Construction Guidelines

## 1. Overview

Passwords are a critical component of information security. Passwords serve to protect user accounts; however, a poorly
constructed password may result in the compromise of individual systems, data, or network. This guideline provides best
practices for creating secure passwords.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this guidelines is to provide best practices for the created of strong passwords.

## 3. Scope

This guideline applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporary and other workers, including all personnel
affiliated with third parties. This guideline applies to all passwords including but not limited to user-level accounts,
system-level accounts, web accounts, e-mail accounts, screen saver protection, voicemail, and local router logins.

## 4. Statement of Guidelines

Strong passwords are long, the more characters you have the stronger the password. We recommend a minimum of 24
characters in your password (unless otherwise limited by the application the password is for). Poor, or weak, passwords
have the following characteristics:

- Contain eight characters or less.
- Contain personal information such as birthdates, addresses, phone numbers, or names of family members, pets, friends,
and fantasy characters.
- Contain number patterns such as aaabbb, qwerty, zyxwvuts, or 123321.
- Are some version of "Welcome123" "Password123" "Changeme123"

In addition, every work account should have a different, unique password. To enable users to maintain multiple
passwords, we highly encourage the use of the 1Password password management software that is authorized and provided by
monetr LLC to all staff. Whenever possible, also enable the use of multifactor authentication.
